Step-by-Step Guide to Buying Property in Greece & Golden Visa

1. Power of Attorney (POA) Preparation if clients travels to Greece – completion in one day
When the client travels to Athens, the process begins with the preparation of a Power of Attorney (POA) in collaboration with a trusted lawyer from our network of partners. The POA is drafted and signed at a Greek Notary and grants the appointed lawyer the authority to:
-Obtain a Greek TAX ID Number (Mandatory for property purchases in Greece, POA & Passport needed) – completion in 5-7 business days
- Open a Greek Bank Account (Facilitates remote banking operations related to the purchase) – completion up to 7 business days. 
-Manage the Entire Property Purchase Process & documents preparation (Includes drafting and signing private agreements, signing the final purchase contract)
-Submit and Oversee the Golden Visa Application (Covers all steps for securing residency through the property investment).
2. Power of Attorney (POA) Preparation & Legalization for remote clients:
If the buyer is remote, these steps are followed to issue a POA locally:
	•	Draft the POA in your country (Client visits a local Notary or Greek Embassy to draft a POA granting the lawyer in Greece authority for property purchase, Golden Visa application and related legal actions).
	•	Authenticate with an Apostille (Apostille the POA to validate it for international use).
	•	Translate and Apostille -Translation of the POA into English using an official translator and Apostille on the translated document.
	•	Send Documents to Us (Send the original POA and English translation (both Apostilled) to our team in Athens via post).
	•	Greek Translation and Submission (Our team translate it into Greek for submission)-completed up to 4 days.
3. Private Purchase Agreement – prepared in 1-2 days
A Private Agreement is drafted and signed between the buyer and the seller, detailing the purchase terms and specifying the deposit required to secure the property. The Private Agreement is signed by the lawyer on the client’s behalf under the authority of the POA, ensuring the client’s interests are fully protected.
4. Payment Terms and Reservation Process
If the buyer is interested, a 5.000 € deposit is required to demonstrate commitment and reserve the apartment by taking it off the market. Following that a Private Agreement is drafted and signed between the buyer and the seller, outlining the purchase terms and specifying the deposit to secure the property. This agreement is signed by the buyer’s lawyer under the authority of a Power of Attorney (PoA), ensuring the buyer's interests are fully protected.
The payment schedule is as follows:
	•	Initial Deposit: 5.000 € upon reservation.
	•	Upon Private Agreement signature: 10% of the purchase price
	•	Second Payment: 10% of the purchase price by the end of February, as construction progresses.
	•	Final Payment: Remaining balance upon the final signature of the purchase contract.
5. Preparation for Final Sale:
Our legal team initiates the process for the final contract, while the client simultaneously prepares the required documents for the Golden Visa application – finalized in 2-3 weeks.
6.Full Payment and Final Contract
The remaining balance is transferred to the seller's account, and the final contract is signed. In 5-7 business days we receive essential documents from the notary, which enable the lawyer to proceed with the Golden Visa application.
7. Golden Visa Application:
Once the notary documents are received, the lawyer holding the POA handles all necessary applications and procedures. A separate detailed list of all required documents will be provided including clear explanations for each.
8. Visa Application Submission
Once all documents are ready and received, within 5-7 busimess days the lawyer submits the Golden Visa application for the main investor and any additional family members, if any.
9. Golden Visa Processing Steps
	•	Confirmation of Submission – same day of submission After submission, the lawyer receives a confirmation letter acknowledging the application is done succesfully.
	•	Proof of Application Receipt   After a few weeks, the Ministry issues a "White Paper," confirming receipt of the application and that it is being processed. 
	•	Biometric Appointment  Around 2-3 weeks after, an invitation for biometric is received and an appointment is scheduled for the client and any additional applicants to provide fingerprints and photos for their visa card issuance. 
	•	Visa Issuance After the biometric step, the visa issuance is a matter of processing time, which can take anywhere from 3-12 months. Our team continuously monitors the process, though the timeline of the Ministry’s operations cannot be influenced.

	•	Final Step: Visa Issuance
Once the visa is issued, the lawyer can collect it on the client’s behalf or the client can pick it up in person.
The client can then enjoy visa-free travel in Europe and the benefits of the Golden Visa.
